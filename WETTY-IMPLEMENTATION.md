# Wetty Module Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

This implementation successfully addresses the requirements to deploy Wetty as a web terminal service with the following characteristics:

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Module Structure**: Created `modules/wetty/` following existing repository patterns
- **Deployment Method**: Uses kubectl manifests (no reliable Helm chart available)
- **Security**: Configured with appropriate security contexts and resource limits  
- **Access Control**: Internal-only ClusterIP service (no external exposure)
- **Feature Flag**: Disabled by default with `enable_wetty = false`

### 🔒 Security & Network Access

**Issue Requirement**: "restricted to Tailscale network (rental-setup branch)"

**Implementation Note**: The current repository uses Cloudflare Tunnel instead of Tailscale, and no `rental-setup` branch exists. To maintain the spirit of "private network access only," the implementation:

- ✅ Deploys as internal-only ClusterIP service
- ✅ No external ingress or Cloudflare Tunnel exposure  
- ✅ Requires kubectl port-forward for access
- ✅ Compatible with Tailscale when used with port-forwarding

### 📱 Mobile & Remote Access

Access method that works with Tailscale networks:

```bash
# On cluster host (connected to Tailscale)
kubectl port-forward -n homelab service/homelab-wetty 3000:3000

# From any Tailscale device
http://your-tailscale-ip:3000
# or
http://your-machine-name:3000  # via MagicDNS
```

### 🛠 Usage

1. **Enable**: Set `enable_wetty = true` in `terraform.tfvars`
2. **Deploy**: Run `terraform apply`
3. **Access**: Use kubectl port-forward + Tailscale IP for mobile access

### 📚 Documentation

- **Module README**: Comprehensive usage and security documentation
- **WETTY-USAGE.md**: Step-by-step guide with Tailscale integration
- **Updated terraform.tfvars.example**: Includes wetty configuration

### 🔐 Security Features

- Non-privileged container execution where possible
- Resource limits enforced (200m CPU, 256Mi memory)
- No external network exposure
- User creation with changeable default password
- Security contexts applied per repository standards

## 🎯 Compatibility Notes

- **Rental-setup branch**: Branch not found in repository
- **Tailscale integration**: Achieved through port-forwarding approach
- **Helm-first approach**: kubectl manifests used due to lack of reliable charts
- **Repository patterns**: Follows existing module structure and naming conventions

This implementation provides secure, maintainable web terminal access suitable for homelab operations while maintaining the private network access requirements.
